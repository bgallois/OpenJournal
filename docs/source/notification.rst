OpenJournal included a system of alarms that can be set using the Add Alarm button on the toolbar or directly in plaintext with the command:

.. code-block:: markdown

    setAlarm(hh:mm,message);

The alarm sound can be activated in the Options menu in the menu bar. In any case, the alarm will display the alarm's message in the system tray.
