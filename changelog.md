## 1.3.0

Version 1.3.0 of OpenJournal comes with several efficiency improvements. The user interface is now smoother with no flickering at refresh in low bandwidth conditions. Version 1.3.0 comes with a new feature called the OpenJournal cloud. It is now possible to store journals on the cloud (after registration) and to update and retrieve journal entries using POST HTTPS requests. This version sees a change in concurrency modification. True concurrency is not supported in OpenJournal. You canâ€™t edit the same journal on several computers. However, one journal open on several computers will update itself if the two subsequent changes on two different computers are separated by more than twenty seconds. With this new behavior, an OpenJournal inactive on some computer can't overwrite the cloud journal opened and possibly modified by another computer.
